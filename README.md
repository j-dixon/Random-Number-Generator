# Random-Number-Generator

JavaScript program to generate an array of random integers.

Random integers are generated based on the following user inputs:
- Lower Limit (The lowest value a generated number can be)
- Upper Limit (The highest value a generated number can be)
- Size of the Array (The number of random numbers generated)

Some additional mathematical operations can be performed on the generated array of integers, these are:
- Sqaure Roots (Find the sqaure root of each number in the array)
- Prime Numbers (Find the prime numbers (if any) that are present in the array
- Total Sum (Calculates the total sum of all the numbers in the array)
- Mean, Median, Model Averages (Calculate the Mean, Median and Mode averages of the array)
- Ranges (Calculates the range of the numbers in the array)

This program is written primarily in JavaScript, with a simple user interface built with HTML and CSS. There is no CSS Framework used in this program.
